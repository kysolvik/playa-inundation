# playa-inundation
Exploring and modeling Playa Lake inundation

## Overview
This repo hosts only the code. The data is available on s3, instructions below. For the code itself, there are 3 directories containing jupyter notebooks:

- **exploration**: Exploring the data, but ALSO some preprocessing.
- **modeling**: Code for modeling inundation. The important notebook is "lstm.ipynb". 
- **analysis**: Analysing the model results and the network weights

## Data
The data is all on s3, both in raw and preprocessed formats. I will add a path and instructions for downloading soon.

Once you've downloaded the data, you can recreate the analysis by following the steps below.

## 1. Exploration

## 2. Modeling

## 3. Analysis
